            <p class="mb-0">OCD is a disorder that causes unwanted, unreasonable thoughts and fears that lead to compulsions. These compulsions interfere with daily life and cause a lot of stress. If one tries to ignore these compulsions, it causes more distress and anxiety. To ease this anxiety and distress, one is driven to fufil their compulses. OCD usually includes both obsessions and compulsions, but it's possible to just have obsessions or compulsions. Some people may not realize the effect of obsessions and compulsions on their lives, but obsessions and compulsions take up a lot of time each day. Some symptoms of obsessions are repeated, persisting, unwanted thoughts, urges or images that cause distress and anxiety that usually intrude while doing other things. Compulsions, on the other hand, are repetitive actions that are meant to reduce anxiety from obsessions or to prevent something bad from happening. Compulsions bring no pleasure and only provide temporary relief. They are often not related to the problem that they are fixing.</p>  
            <p><p>The causes for OCD aren't understood yet, but there are theories that link it to biology, genetics, and environment.</p>
